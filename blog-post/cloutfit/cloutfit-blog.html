                <p class="pb-4">
                    One day, while shopping for clothes online (an activity I don't particularly enjoy), I realised how difficult it was to find clothes that really suited my taste. 
                    As I went through hundreds of options that I didn't like, I thought about how useful an app that recommended clothes based on my personal preferences would be.</p>
                    <!-- pon en diderentes tiendas <-  -->
                <p class="pb-4">
                    The first thing I did was research to see if something similar already existed. I had heard of apps that recommended certain clothes or styles based on the user's
                    physical characteristics and tastes. However, after an exhaustive search, I came to the conclusion that none of the available options really convinced me, so
                    I decided to develop my own version with a fresh approach, away from the current methods that require the user to fill out endless forms about their characteristics and preferences,
                    a process that can be so tedious that it ends up taking away the desire to buy.</p>
                
                <p class="pb-4">
                    My goal was to change the approach to this type of application and make the experience of defining preferences fun and dynamic.
                    Inspired by current interaction trends, such as infinite scrolling, I came up with a more agile way of getting to know each user's tastes: 
                    showing them images of different garments that they could rate in a binary way, simply by indicating whether they liked them or not.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl dark:text-white">But which clothes are going to be recommended?</h2>

                <p class="pb-4">
                    For the application to be really useful, we need to get the clothes that are popular with consumers. Therefore, I decided that the best 
                    option was to offer product recommendations from the most popular stores and brands in Spain, allowing the user to explore and receive clothing 
                    recommendations from different stores in a single platform. To do this, I used 
                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357401723_Web_Scraping_or_Web_Crawling_State_of_Art_Techniques_Approaches_and_Application" 
                    class="dark:text-blue-600 hover:border-b-2 hover:border-blue-600">web scraping</a> techniques that were implemented in 
                    <a href="https://www.python.org" class="dark:text-blue-600 hover:border-b-2 hover:border-blue-600">Python</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl dark:text-white">Final product</h2>
                <p class="pb-4">
                    Using the ideas above, I developed a mobile application called Cloutfit using <a href="https://reactnative.dev" class="dark:text-blue-600 hover:border-b-2 hover:border-blue-600">React Native</a>,
                    which aims to improve the online clothing shopping experience.
                    Cloutfit brings together clothes from different stores in a single place, allowing the user to consider multiple options and brands. It also offers a
                    recommendation algorithm based on the user's preferences, with the aim of simplifying and minimising the search time needed to find the desired garments.
                    Finally, to make the purchase, users are redirected to the original stores to complete the transaction.</p>
